# Case-study-Debt-Crisis-of-SriLanka
Conclusions, 
The purpose of this case study is to examine the factors which drove Sri Lanka into a debt 
crisis. As per the results from the regression analysis where the relationship between the 
national debt and the budget deficit is investigated, the study finds an inverse relationship 
between the two variables. The governments of Sri Lanka have shown a pattern of obtaining 
more debt while increasing budget deficits over the past years. This can be identified as a 
major cause of the current debt crisis in the island. 
We can conclude that policies have majorly contributed to debt service payments due to the 
inverse relationship between exports and debt service payments, given that the exports are 
affected by the policies. Furthermore, the study concludes that policies affect economic 
growth, since exports show a significant impact on GDP growth, given that exports are highly 
affected by the policies implemented.
Next, the study analyses the costs and funding in the roads and highway sector. The study 
concludes that these projects do not earn enough revenue to cover up their initial 
investments. In a backdrop where the projects are funded majorly through foreign debt 
and when those projects do not earn enough revenue, more debt is allocated to service those 
initial debts. This leads up to a continuous rise in highway debt and thus the rise in national 
debt.
Finally, the case study investigates debt management policies followed by a model nation, 
Singapore and compares the effect of national debt on economic growth between Singapore 
and Sri Lanka. Here it shows that there is a more favorable effect on economic growth by 
national debt in Singapore relative to that in Sri Lanka. The policies that have been followed 
by the governments of Singapore offers insights into better debt management which can be 
followed by Sri Lanka to overcome the current debt crisis
